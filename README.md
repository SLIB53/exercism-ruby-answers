Exercism Ruby Answers
================================================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/SLIB53/exercism-ruby-answers.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/SLIB53/exercism-ruby-answers)

[Exercism.io][exercism] provides practice problems and mentorship for most programming langauges. This repository contains my solutions to the ["Ruby Track"][exercism-ruby-track]. I've been having a lot of fun with [Elixir lately][exercism-elixir-answers], so I thought I'd practice some Ruby as well and see how it is first hand.

Running Tests
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For each solution, run the ruby test script from the solution folder. Check the README for further instructions. You will need the `minitest` gem for all tests.

```sh
ruby <solution_dir>/<solution_name>_test.exs
```

To run all the tests, use the `test_all.sh` script.

```sh
sh test_all.sh
```
